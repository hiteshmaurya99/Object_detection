# Object_detection Yolo nas 
Here i used a pre trained state of the art model called Yolo_nas_s(small version) developed by super gradients.
It was pretrained on the  coco dataset.
I imported the model and trained it on my dataset which was taken from Kaggle -Plastic Bottles Dataset.
The dataset was loaded on google drive which i then mounted to the colab notebook so all the files generated will be save there which includes the best performing weights for my custom dataset.
